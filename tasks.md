Location: config.py

Impact: Rate limiting lost on restart, doesn't scale across instances Fix Required: Redis backend for production

P1 - HIGH PRIORITY
5. E2E Test Failures
Evidence: Multiple test failure snapshots showing "internal server error" Impact: Authentication flows not working in browser tests Fix Required: Debug and fix authentication test setup

6. Database Performance Issues
Location: Multiple models missing indexes Impact: Poor query performance at scale Fix Required: Add indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried fields

7. Missing Docker Configuration
Impact: No containerization strategy Fix Required: Docker files for backend, frontend, and infrastructure

P2 - MEDIUM PRIORITY
8. Incomplete Game Implementations
Locations:

GameScene.js - Console errors
BootScene.js - TODO comments Impact: Some games not fully functional Fix Required: Complete game implementations
9. Frontend Error Handling Gaps
Evidence: Coverage reports show uncovered error paths in API interceptors Impact: Poor user experience during errors Fix Required: Improve error handling coverage
