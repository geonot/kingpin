Test script to demonstrate working Bitcoin integration for Kingpin Casino.
This script tests all the core Bitcoin functionality including:
- Wallet generation and encryption (now covered by automated pytest tests)
- Address derivation (now covered by automated pytest tests)
- Transaction creation (simulated - kept for manual demonstration)

    Test Bitcoin transaction creation (Simulated - Kept for manual demonstration).
    Note: This function demonstrates the use of send_to_hot_wallet.
    In a real test environment, send_to_hot_wallet would be mocked to prevent actual transactions.
    The bitcoinlib library might attempt real network interactions if not configured for a specific testnet
    and if the underlying functions are not fully dummied out due to missing dependencies.
    This specific test in this script is more of a live manual utility check than an automated test.
    It's recommended to run this only in a controlled development environment if live calls are made.
    Automated tests for withdrawal processing now exist in test_bitcoin_wallet_management.py with mocking.
