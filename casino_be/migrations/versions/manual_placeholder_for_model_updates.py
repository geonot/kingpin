def upgrade():
    # ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    # In a real scenario, Alembic would generate schema changes here.
    # This is a placeholder due to environment limitations preventing autogeneration.
    #
    # Key changes that would have been detected based on models.py:
    #
    # 1. New Tables:
    #    - token_blacklist: For storing JTI of revoked JWTs.
    #      Fields: id (Integer, primary_key), jti (String(36), nullable=False, index=True, unique=True),
    #              created_at (DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False),
    #              expires_at (DateTime(timezone=True), nullable=False, index=True).
    #    Note: blackjack_table, blackjack_hand, blackjack_action were likely created by migration 0006.
    #          Alembic would check if their current structure in models.py differs from that migration
    #          and generate alterations if needed (e.g., adding new indexes).
    #
    # 2. Modifications to existing tables (compared to schema after migration 0008):
    #    - user:
    #        - balance: Type change to BigInteger (if not already, e.g., if initial was Integer). Add index.
    #        - email: Add index (if not already).
    #        - username: Add index (if not already).
    #        - is_active: Added Boolean field (default=True, nullable=False).
    #        - last_login_at: Added DateTime(timezone=True) field (nullable=True).
    #        - (password, deposit_wallet_private_key, deposit_wallet_address might have length/type consistency checks)
    #
    #    - game_session:
    #        - slot_id: Ensure nullable=True. Add index. (table_id and game_type already added by 0007, 0008)
    #        - table_id: Add index (if not already added by 0007).
    #        - amount_wagered, amount_won: Type change to BigInteger (if not already).
    #        - bonus_spins_remaining: Column name might have changed from 'bonus_spins'.
    #        - session_end: Add index.
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #        - (spin_amount column would be dropped if it existed and is no longer in models.py)
    #
    #    - slot_spin:
    #        - spin_result: Type change to JSONB.
    #        - win_amount, bet_amount: Type change to BigInteger.
    #        - is_bonus_spin: Added Boolean field (default=False, nullable=False).
    #        - spin_time: Add index.
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #
    #    - transaction:
    #        - amount: Type change to BigInteger.
    #        - details: Type change to JSONB.
    #        - Indexes added for user_id, transaction_type, status, created_at.
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #
    #    - bonus_code:
    #        - description: Added Text field.
    #        - uses_remaining: Added Integer field (nullable=True).
    #        - is_active: Added Boolean field (default=True, nullable=False). Add index.
    #        - code_id: Add index.
    #        - expires_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #        - (amount field is Float, which is fine for percentages but needs care if representing Satoshis for fixed bonuses)
    #
    #    - slot:
    #        - num_rows, num_columns, num_symbols: Added Integer fields (nullable=False).
    #        - wild_symbol_id, scatter_symbol_id: Added Integer fields (nullable=True).
    #        - bonus_type, bonus_subtype: Added String fields (nullable=True).
    #        - bonus_multiplier: Added Float field (default=1.0, nullable=False).
    #        - bonus_spins_trigger_count: Added Integer field (default=3, nullable=False).
    #        - bonus_spins_awarded: Added Integer field (default=10, nullable=False).
    #        - asset_directory: Added String field (default='', nullable=False).
    #        - rtp, volatility: Added Float/String fields (nullable=True).
    #        - is_active: Add index.
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #
    #    - slot_symbol: (Assuming this table was created in an early migration for slot data)
    #        - slot_id: Add index.
    #        - symbol_internal_id: Added Integer field (nullable=False).
    #        - data: Type change to JSONB.
    #        - UniqueConstraint on ('slot_id', 'symbol_internal_id').
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #
    #    - slot_bet: (Assuming this table was created in an early migration for slot data)
    #        - slot_id: Add index.
    #        - bet_amount: Type change to BigInteger.
    #        - UniqueConstraint on ('slot_id', 'bet_amount').
    #        - created_at: Ensure DateTime(timezone=True).
    #
    #    - blackjack_table: (Created in 0006)
    #        - Potentially add/update indexes if models.py has them defined now.
    #        - Ensure created_at, updated_at are DateTime(timezone=True).
    #        - Ensure min_bet, max_bet are BigInteger.
    #        - Ensure rules is JSONB.
    #
    #    - blackjack_hand: (Created in 0006)
    #        - Add indexes for user_id, table_id, session_id, status (if not already present).
    #        - Ensure created_at, updated_at, completed_at are DateTime(timezone=True).
    #        - Ensure bet/win amounts are BigInteger.
    #        - Ensure card/hand fields are JSONB.
    #
    #    - blackjack_action: (Created in 0006)
    #        - Add index for hand_id (if not already present).
    #        - Ensure card_dealt is JSONB.
    #        - Ensure created_at is DateTime(timezone=True).
    #
    # 3. General Type Changes & Indexing:
    #    - Consistent use of BigInteger for all currency/satoshi amounts.
    #    - Consistent use of JSONB for JSON fields (PostgreSQL specific).
    #    - Consistent use of DateTime(timezone=True) for all timestamp fields.
    #    - Addition of new indexes on foreign keys and frequently queried columns.
