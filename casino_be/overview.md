Status: Placeholder implementation only
Risk: Core payment functionality non-functional
Requirements:
Complete wallet service implementation
Secure private key management (HSM/vault)
Transaction monitoring and sweeping
Production-grade Bitcoin node integration
2. Real-time Game Features
Issue: Games like Poker and Spacecrash use HTTP polling
Impact: Poor user experience, server load
Solution: WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
3. Database Optimization
Issues: Missing indexes, potential performance bottlenecks
Risk: Poor performance under load
Requirements: Query optimization, proper indexing strategy
4. Production Environment Configuration
Missing: Docker configuration, reverse proxy setup
Risk: Deployment complexity, scaling limitations
Required: Containerization, load balancing, SSL termination
üü° Medium Priority (Important)
1. Rate Limiting Scalability
Issue: Currently uses memory:// storage
Impact: Not suitable for multi-instance deployment
Solution: Redis backend for production (already configured)
2. Error Handling & Monitoring
Gaps: Limited production error tracking
Requirements:
Structured logging with correlation IDs
Application performance monitoring (APM)
Error aggregation and alerting
3. Game Feature Completions
Poker: Basic UI, missing advanced features
Baccarat: Early-stage Phaser implementation
Advanced Slot Features: Some complex mechanics unimplemented
