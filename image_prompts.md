# Quantum Plinko - Image Generation Prompts

This document outlines the image generation prompts for the visual assets of the Quantum Plinko game. The desired style is sleek, futuristic, with glowing elements and a high-tech feel.

## 1. Game Board & Elements

### 1.1. Main Game Board Background
*   **Prompt:** "A sleek, futuristic Plinko board background. Dark metallic tones (deep blues, purples, gunmetal grey) with subtle integrated circuitry patterns or faint nebulous glows. A sense of depth and advanced technology. Minimalist, clean lines. Aspect ratio 4:3 (e.g., 800x600)."
*   **Notes:** Should not be too busy, allowing pegs and particles to stand out.

### 1.2. Pegs (Standard)
*   **Prompt:** "Set of small, cylindrical pegs for a futuristic Plinko game. Polished chrome or translucent energy material. Subtle internal glow (cool blue or white). About 32x32 pixels if sprite sheet, or individual high-res for scaling."
*   **Variations:** Perhaps a few minor variations in glow intensity or texture.

### 1.3. Multiplier Pegs
*   **Prompt:** "Special Multiplier Peg for a futuristic Plinko game. Similar material to standard pegs but with a distinct, vibrant orange or amber glow. May have a subtle energy aura or small, distinct markings (e.g., 'x2', 'x3' symbols if legible at small size). Size similar to standard pegs."
*   **Notes:** Clearly distinguishable from standard pegs.

### 1.4. Portal Pegs (Pair)
*   **Prompt:** "Pair of Portal Pegs for a futuristic Plinko game. One 'entry' and one 'exit'. Swirling energy effect within the peg (e.g., miniature galaxy or vortex). Color: vibrant cyan or electric purple. When active, the portal effect could intensify. Size similar to standard pegs."
*   **Notes:** Entry and exit could have slightly different energy patterns or a directional flow indicator.

### 1.5. Bumpers (Optional - if added later)
*   **Prompt:** "Futuristic, angled bumper elements for a Plinko board. Sleek, metallic with glowing edges (e.g., neon blue). Designed to dynamically redirect a particle with force. Various angles (e.g., 45-degree, 90-degree)."

### 1.6. Accelerators (Optional - if added later)
*   **Prompt:** "Futuristic accelerator strips or pads for a Plinko board. Glowing chevrons or light strips indicating direction of speed boost. Material: translucent energy panel or polished metal with inlaid light tracks."

## 2. Particle (The "Ball")

### 2.1. Digital Particle
*   **Prompt:** "A glowing digital 'particle' or orb for a futuristic Plinko game. Sphere of pure energy, possibly with a small, bright core and a softer surrounding aura. Color: vibrant electric blue or magenta. Should have a distinct trail effect when moving."
*   **Size:** Approx 16x16 to 24x24 pixels.
*   **Animation States:**
    *   Standard state (idle/moving).
    *   Impact flash (brighter, slightly expanded aura for a few frames).
    *   Trail (separate asset or shader effect guidance: long, fading glow).

## 3. Prize Slots

### 3.1. Prize Slot (Standard)
*   **Prompt:** "Futuristic prize slot for a Plinko game. Rectangular, with a receiving area for the particle. Clean metallic frame with an illuminated interior that can change color (e.g., soft blue when idle, green for win). Clear indication of where the particle enters."
*   **Notes:** Should be wide enough for the particle. Design for bottom of the board.

### 3.2. Jackpot Slot
*   **Prompt:** "High-value Jackpot Slot for a futuristic Plinko game. Ornate or more prominent design than standard slots. Rich gold or platinum metallic frame with intense, pulsating light effects (e.g., rainbow spectrum or bright white/gold glow). May have 'JACKPOT' subtly engraved or holographically projected above it."
*   **Notes:** Must look significantly more rewarding than standard slots.

## 4. UI Elements

### 4.1. Buttons
*   **Prompt:** "Set of futuristic UI buttons (e.g., 'Drop Particle', 'Increase Bet', 'Decrease Bet'). Translucent material with glowing text or icons. Beveled edges, minimalist design. States: normal, hover, pressed."
*   **Example Text/Icons:** "DROP", "+", "-".

### 4.2. Information Displays/Panels
*   **Prompt:** "Sleek, futuristic UI panel for displaying text (e.g., 'Balance:', 'Multiplier:', 'Prize:'). Semi-transparent dark background with clean, glowing digital font. Minimalist border."

## 5. Special Effects (Conceptual - for particle systems or animations)

### 5.1. Particle Trail
*   **Prompt:** "Visual concept for a glowing particle trail. A fading streak of light, matching the particle's color. Smooth, possibly with tiny sparks or motes of light within the trail."

### 5.2. Peg Impact Spark
*   **Prompt:** "Visual concept for a spark effect when a particle hits a peg. Small, bright burst of energy particles. Color: white, light blue, or matching particle color."

### 5.3. Slot Collection Effect
*   **Prompt:** "Visual concept for when a particle is collected in a prize slot. An upward burst of light and energy particles from the slot, possibly with a soft implosion/absorption effect for the particle itself."

### 5.4. Portal Activation/Teleport Effect
*   **Prompt:** "Visual concept for portal activation. Swirling energy at the entry portal, particle dematerializes. Rematerialization effect at the exit portal with a flash of light."

### 5.5. Jackpot Win Celebration
*   **Prompt:** "Visual concept for a Jackpot win screen flash or animation. Explosive burst of light, showering particles, glowing 'JACKPOT!' text. Colors: gold, bright white, rainbow highlights."
