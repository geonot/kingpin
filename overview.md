ðŸ“ˆ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (This Week)
Set up comprehensive logging - Add structured logging to catch errors in production
Implement basic unit tests - Start with critical game logic functions
Security review - Audit authentication flows and input validation
Database constraints - Add missing foreign key relationships
Error handling - Improve error boundaries in Vue components
ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL DEBT AREAS
Hardcoded values - Move magic numbers to configuration
Mixed authentication patterns - Standardize JWT handling
Inconsistent error responses - Standardize API error format
Missing validation - Add comprehensive input validation
Performance bottlenecks - Optimize heavy database operations
This analysis shows a sophisticated and feature-rich casino platform with strong foundations but needing focused attention on security, testing, and performance optimization to reach production readiness.
